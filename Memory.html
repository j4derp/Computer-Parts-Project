            <h1>Memory</h1>
            <div class="info-section">
                <h2>Memory Characteristics</h2>
<p>The best way to ensure that you get the correct RAM for a system is to consult the motherboard documentation. In addition, there are several websites on the internet where you can look up the system or scan the system to find the correct memory type to install. When selecting RAM, consider the following factors:</p>
                <img src="memory.jpg" alt="memory" class="section-image">
                
                <h2>Packaging (memory form)</h2>
             <p>When you are purchasing RAM for a system, the most important consideration is the packaging, also called memory form. Keep in mind:</p>
                <div class="feature-list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Packaging and capacity must be supported by the motherboard.</li>
<li>The packaging controls both the physical size of the memory module and the memory standard (e.g., DDR2, DDR3, DDR4).
<li>If you purchase the wrong type of RAM:
<ul><li>It will most likely not fit.</li>
<li>If does fit, it might have different voltage requirements than what is supported by the motherboard.</li></ul></li>
                   
                    </ul>
                 <h2>Capacity</h2>
                 <p>The capacity (sometimes called the size) refers to the storage capacity of the memory module (e.g., 256 MB, 512 MB, 1 GB). The total capacity of memory that you can install in a system is limited by:</p>
                 <ul
                  <li>The number of memory slots on the motherboard.</li>
                  <li>The maximum total capacity that can be installed. For example, most systems will have a maximum capacity of between 3 GB and 16 GB of RAM.</li>
                  <li>The maximum module capacity. For example, the motherboard might be able to accept only up to 2 GB or 4 GB modules.</li>
                  <li>The maximum amount of memory that can be addressed (used) by the operating system. A 32-bit operating system can use between 3 GB and 4 GB of memory, while a 64-bit operating system can use much more.</li>
</ul>
                 <p>For example,</p>
                 <ul>
                  <li>A motherboard has a total of three slots, with a maximum module size of 8 GB and a system maximum of 24 GB.</li>
                  <li>You have two 4 GB modules installed.</li>
                  <li>You can add only a single 8 GB module.</li>
                  <li>That brings the total up to 16 GB.</li>
                  <li>You could also replace one or both of the 4 GB modules, bringing the total to 20 or 24 GB respectively.</li>
                 </ul>
              

                <h2>Parity RAM	</h2>
         
      
<p>Parity memory is a type of memory that checks for common kinds of internal data corruption. It does not correct internal data corruption. Non-parity memory does not perform error checking.</p>               

                 <h2>Memory Troubleshooting</h2>
                 <h3>The system boot fails and sounds a beep code</h3>
<p>Either no memory is installed or the memory was not detected.</p>
                  <h3>The system boots, but the display remains blank	</h3>
                 <p>Either a card or memory module is not seated, or the system includes unsupported memory. Non-parity RAM is incompatible with ECC memory; SDRAM is incompatible with EDO memory.</p>
                 <h3>The system boots, but the memory count is incorrect	</h3>
                 <p>The POST failed to recognize all the memory. This can happen with incompatible memory installation. Remember to avoid combining dual-bank with single-bank memory. If you detect a problem during system boot, check the BIOS settings.</p>
